        <b>Q:</b> Your scoring and ranking does not fit my preferences. Can I change the composition of test groups?
        <br>
        <b>A:</b> Unfortunately, this is not possible at the moment. This will be possible after the beta phase.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Q:</b> Do you also check what the websites will do with my personal information?
        <br>
        <b>A:</b> We can only assess things that can be determined automatically. PrivacyScore does not analyze privacy policies or make any statements about the general trustworthiness of the website.

        <b>Q:</b> Can we host a separate instance of PrivacyScore on our own servers?
        <br>
        <b>A:</b> Yes. We have published our source code including scripts for simplified  deployment. See the <a href="/code/">Code</a> section on our website for more details.
