"""
This module takes care of the basic evaluation of scan results.

Currently, each key of a group is mapped to good/bad. A group is rated as good
if all keys are good, as warning if some but not all keys are rated good and
bad if all keys are rated bad.

This is only a draft and will most likely be changed essentially later.
