## This is an ansible inventory file <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_inventory.html>
## 
## 1) We first have the general section to describe the hosts that we want to provision.
## 2) Then we have group definitions. Your host should be in either master or slave  and then in either of
##    production, staging, or testing.  Although your host can also be both master and slave.
## 3) Finally, some variable definitions for the groups which haven't (yet) been migrated to separate files.
##
## In order to run ansible against a certain group, run it with, e.g. --limit testing:
##      ansible-playbook --inventory ansible/inventory  --limit testing   ansible/update_hosts.yml
##

## A master is where the Web interface is hosted and from where scan-requests are

## Slaves are the actual Web scanners who connect to the queue to get new jobs.
## They run the scanners and return the results to the master.

## If we ever have a staging area to test the software in a
## production-like environment, we'd add the hosts here

## Finally, these are the hosts which is expect to be part
