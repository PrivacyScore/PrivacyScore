# is_master: Determines whether a host is to be deployed as a master.
#            The master is showing the Web interface and running the job queue.
#            It also runs a redis for the clients to put their results in.
#            Defaults to None to indicate that it hasn't been set yet.
#            The value should be set for the master group.
is_master: None

# is_slave: Determines whether a host is to be deployed as a slave.

#           return their results to the master's redis database.
#           Defaults to None. You should probably not set this value yourself,
#           but rather have it set by putting your host into the slave group.
