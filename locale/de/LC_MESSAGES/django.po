"                <p><strong>How are the results presented?</strong> Our "
"analysis focuses on the following aspects: whether tracking services are "
"used (\"NoTrack\" category), whether selected attacks are prevented, the "
"quality of encryption during data transmission to the website (EncWeb), and "
"the quality when sending e-mails to an existing e-mail server (EncMail). You "
"can control how important these four criteria are for you with the arrows in "
"the column headings.</p>\n"
"\n"
"                <p><strong>What exactly is checked and what do the results "
"mean?</strong> We check the internet addresses with several techniques, "
"which we have described in detail in a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/"
"abs/1705.05139\">research paper</a>. You can display a list of all checks "
"and explanations of their relevance by clicking on the address of a web page "
"to display its detailed results.</p>\n"
"\n"
"                <p><strong>What is the purpose of PrivacyScore?</strong> "
"With PrivacyScore we make websites publicly comparable in terms of selected "
"properties. As scientists, we are interested in how users and operators deal "
"with this form of transparency. Among other things, this raises the question "
"of whether website operators have an additional incentive to improve their "
"websites.</p>\n"
"\n"
"                <p><strong>What can be concluded from the results, what not?"
"</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"                <p><strong>No statement about the importance of the "
"categories.</strong> The table sorts the listed web pages according to the "
"importance you specify. The further up a website is sorted, the more tests "
"it has passed in the respective categories. In the event of a tie, the "
"following category will decide. The default sorting is according to the "
"category \"No Track\", followed by \"EncWeb\", \"Attacks\", and \"EncMail\". "
"However, this default ranking should not be interpreted as an indication of "
"the importance of the categories.</p>\n"
"\n"
"                <p><strong>No statement on necessity.</strong> The fact that "
"a web page is ranked at the lower end says nothing about its absolute "
"security level. The results shown on this page merely provide information on "
"how the listed websites perform in a direct comparison. Some security "
"mechanisms are only necessary to protect against strong attacks (e.g., "
"governments).</p>\n"
"\n"
"                <p><strong>Limited expressiveness.</strong> The results "
"cover only security mechanisms that can be observed from outside when "
"visiting the specified Internet addresses. It is quite possible that an "
"operator uses additional internal protection mechanisms and therefore has "
"decided to leave out some externally visible mechanisms. Furthermore, it is "
"possible that additional security mechanisms are used on individual pages (e."
"g., for the transmission of passwords). However, such variations are not "
"taken into account in the analysis. Therefore, one cannot conclude from the "
"failure of individual tests that a provider does not handle personal data "
"with sufficient care. On the other hand, however, it is also possible that a "
"website has serious security holes, although it achieves a good result on "
"this page.</p>\n"

"                <p><strong>Beschränkte Aussagekraft.</strong> Die Ergebnisse "

"möglich, dass ein Betreiber intern zusätzliche Schutzmechanismen einsetzt "
"und daher auf einige von außen sichtbare Mechanismen verzichtet. Weiterhin "
"kann es sein, dass auf einzelnen Seiten (z.B. bei der Übertragung von "
"Passwörtern) zusätzliche Sicherheitsmechanismen eingesetzt werden. Solche "
"Abweichungen werden in der Auswertung allerdings nicht berücksichtigt. Daher "
"kann man einerseits aus dem Fehlschlagen einzelner Prüfungen nicht folgern, "
"dass ein Anbieter nicht ausreichend sorgfältig mit personenbezogenen Daten "
"umgeht. Auf der anderen Seite ist es allerdings auch möglich, dass eine "

"                        <p><strong>How are the results presented?</strong> "
"Our analysis focuses on the following aspects: whether tracking services are "
"used (\"NoTrack\" category), whether selected attacks are prevented, the "
"quality of encryption during data transmission to the website (EncWeb), and "
"the quality when sending e-mails to an existing e-mail server (EncMail).</"
"p>\n"
"\n"
"\t                <p><strong>What exactly is checked and what do the results "
"mean?</strong> We check the internet addresses with several techniques, "
"which we have described in detail in a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/"
"abs/1705.05139\">research paper</a>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t                <p><strong>What is the purpose of PrivacyScore?</strong> "
"With PrivacyScore we make websites publicly comparable in terms of selected "
"properties. As scientists, we are interested in how users and operators deal "
"with this form of transparency. Among other things, this raises the question "
"of whether website operators have an additional incentive to improve their "
"websites.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t                <p><strong>What can be concluded from the results, what "
"not?</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"\t                <p><strong>No statement on necessity.</strong> The fact "
"that a web page fails at a specific does not automatically mean that "
"sensitive pieces data are at risk. Some security mechanisms are only "
"necessary to protect against strong attacks (e.g., by governments).</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t                <p><strong>Limited expressiveness.</strong> The results "
"cover only security mechanisms that can be observed from outside when "
"visiting the specified internet addresses. It is quite possible that an "
"operator uses additional internal protection mechanisms and therefore has "
"decided to leave out some externally visible mechanisms. Furthermore, it is "
"possible that additional security mechanisms are used on individual pages (e."
"g., for the transmission of passwords). However, such variations are not "
"taken into account in the analysis. Therefore, one cannot conclude from the "
"failure of individual checks that a provider does not handle personal data "
"with sufficient care. On the other hand, however, it is also possible that a "
"website has serious security holes, although it achieves a good result on "
"this page.</p>\n"

"Im einzelnen untersuchen wir, ob Tracking-Dienste verwendet werden "
"(Kategorie „NoTrack“), ob ausgewählte Angriffe verhindert werden (Attacks) "
"sowie die Qualität der Verschlüsselung bei der Datenübertragung zur Webseite "
"(EncWeb) bzw. beim Versand von Mails an einen ggf. vorhandenen E-Mail-Server "
"(EncMail).</p>\n"
"\n"
"                <p><strong>Was genau wird überprüft und was bedeuten die "
"Ergebnisse?</strong> Wir überprüfen Internetadressen mit mehreren Techniken, "
"die wir in einem <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/"
"abs/1705.05139\">Forschungspapier</a> ausführlich beschrieben haben. Eine "
"Aufstellung der einzelnen Prüfungen und Erklärungen zu deren Relevanz "
"erhalten Sie, wenn Sie sich das Detailergebnis einer Webseite anzeigen "

"\n"
"                <p><strong>Welchen Zweck hat PrivacyScore?</strong> Mit "
"PrivacyScore machen wir Webseiten im Hinblick auf ausgewählte Eigenschaften "
"öffentlich vergleichbar. Als Wissenschaftler interessiert uns, wie Nutzer "
"und Betreiber mit dieser Form von Transparenz umgehen. Unter anderem stellt "
"sich die Frage, ob Betreiber von Webseiten dadurch einen zusätzlichen Anreiz "
"zur Verbesserung ihrer Webseiten haben.</p>\n"
"\n"
"                <p><strong>Was kann man aus den Ergebnissen ablesen, was "
"nicht?</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"                <p><strong>Keine Aussage zur Erforderlichkeit.</strong> Wenn "
"ein Test bei einer Webseite ein negatives Ergebnis hat, bedeutet das nicht "
"unbedingt, dass ein Risiko für sensible Daten besteht. Einige "
"Sicherheitsmechanismen sind lediglich erforderlich, um vor starken Angreifen "
"(z.B. Regierungen) zu schützen.</p>\n"
"\n"
"                <p><strong>Beschränkte Aussagekraft.</strong> Die Ergebnisse "
"beziehen sich ausschließlich auf Sicherheitsmechanismen, die beim Besuch der "
"angegebenen Internetadressen von außen beobachtbar sind. Es ist durchaus "
"möglich, dass ein Betreiber intern zusätzliche Schutzmechanismen einsetzt "
"und daher auf einige von außen sichtbare Mechanismen verzichtet. Weiterhin "
"kann es sein, dass auf einzelnen Seiten (z.B. bei der Übertragung von "
"Passwörtern) zusätzliche Sicherheitsmechanismen eingesetzt werden. Solche "
"Abweichungen werden in der Auswertung allerdings nicht berücksichtigt. Daher "
"kann man einerseits aus dem Fehlschlagen einzelner Prüfungen nicht folgern, "
"dass ein Anbieter nicht ausreichend sorgfältig mit personenbezogenen Daten "
"umgeht. Auf der anderen Seite ist es allerdings auch möglich, dass eine "
"Webseite schwere Sicherheitslücken aufweist, obwohl sie ein gutes Ergebnis "
"erzielt.</p>\n"
